5 round, minimalistic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in JavaScript, HTML and CSS

First, the user picks a choice

Then, the computer generates a pseudo-random choice

Then the program evaluates the winner, or tie, and adds to the score accordingly

The first to reach 5 wins, wins the game. To reset the game you can just refresh the page

This is the updated version. It uses DOM manipulation to allow the game to have a UI. 
Most of the game happens in JavaScript, while the HTML and CSS are kept very simple.

This version was a great exercise of DOM manipulation. While the game has a lot of room for improvement, I wanted to have a simple, finished version that worked.

Things that can be worked on:

- Add a prompt that allows the player to pick their name
- Add a reset button when the game ends
- Show unclickable buttons just like the player ones, that highlight showing the computer choice
- If the previous feature is implemented, then the message at the bottom of the page could just be
'player wins', 'computer wins' or 'tie'
