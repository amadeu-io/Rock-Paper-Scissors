New 5 round Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in JavaScript.

This is the updated version. It uses DOM manipulation to allow the game to happen in the page and not in the console.

When the game ends, if you want to play again you need to refresh the page. Note to self: An upgrade possibility is to add a reset button that does it.
